I hear it in your voice and see it on your face when you say I love you too
It's got me thinking if there ain't somethin I did or didn't do
Girl I ain't got a clue
I can see the lies from behind your eyes and they're making their way to the front
Seems like everyday there's something you can't say
Just tell me what you really want
Cause I can't be the one
To do what needs to be done
Baby if this were up to me
Our names would be carved in an old oak tree
A picnic blanket and cheap red wine
Your long tan legs tangles up with mine
But that ain't the way you see it
If you've lost the flame then so be it
Don't be afraid to shoot me straight
Pull me up
Or pull me under
But baby don't make me wonder
Why I am I still in the dark with you still in my arms
Tell me something tell me anything
Cause things don't feel the same
Baby if this were up to me
Our names would be carved in an old oak tree
A picnic blanket and cheap red wine
Your long tan legs tangles up with mine
But that ain't the way you see it
If you've lost the flame then so be it
Don't be afraid to shoot me straight
Pull me up
Or pull me under
But baby don't make me wonder
Baby if this were up to me
Our names would be carved in an old oak tree
A picnic blanket and cheap red wine
Your long tan legs tangles up with mine
But that ain't the way you see it
If you've lost the flame then so be it
Don't be afraid to shoot me straight
Pull me up
Or pull me under
Pull me up
Or pull me under
But baby don't make me wonder
