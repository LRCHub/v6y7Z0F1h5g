Turn down the light
Fall back in time
Tell me you'll go
And I will not go
Your mouth and bow
Could try make me wonder
What's on your mind
Am I falling behind?
All you gotta say is that it's over any way we go
Heat it when it's hot until you hold it, till I find it in snow
No, don't get me back now, now, now
I'll grow for growth without
You make me wonder
Heart full of stone
Why do I hold on
When we got it all wrong?
Days get so long here
Eyes are wide open
Was it always this fake here?
Lost long ago
Am I falling for you?
All you gotta say is that it's over any way we go
Heat it when it's hot until you hold it, till I find it in snow
No, don't get me back now, now, now
I'll grow for growth without
You make me wonder
Full suitcase
What's your reason in disguising where we know we're going?
Full suitcase
Are you listening to up to me when we saw what's coming?
Full suitcase
What's your reason in disguising where we know we're going?
Full suitcase
Are you listening to up to me when we saw what's coming?
Holding on now, when we got it going down, holding on now
Holding on now, when we got it going down, holding on now
Holding on now, when we got it going down, holding on now
Now, now, now, I'll grow for growth without
You make me wonder
